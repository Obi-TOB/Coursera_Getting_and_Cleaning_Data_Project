Details on R code to generate data
==================================
The R code creates the mean values of the original source data for each subject and activity.

In particular for the creation of this data set the following transformations have been applied:
[1] Training and Test sets have been merged into one data set
[2] Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement have been isolated.
[3] Numeric activity names in the data set have been replaced by their corresponding textual representation
[4] The dataset has been amended with with descriptive variable names
[5] For each Activity and Subject a mean values has been calculated. For each original column xxx_std() or xxx_mean() a corresponding variable Mean_xxx_std() and Mean_xxx_mean() have been included in the current dataset.

For further details on the source data follow the references in the Codebook.md
