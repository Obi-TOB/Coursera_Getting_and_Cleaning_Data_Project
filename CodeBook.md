Data
====
This data set is based on the data set distributed in relation to the Coursera class "Getting & Cleaning data". The orignal dataset has been distributed under http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

Each line in the data corresponds shows the mean of all observations per subject and activity for all variables.


Transformations
=================

The data contains mean values of the original data for each subject and activity.

In particular for the creation of this data set the following transformations have been applied:
[1] Training and Test sets have been merged into one data set
[2] Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement have been isolated.
[3] Numeric activity names in the data set have been replaced by their corresponding textual representation
[4] The dataset has been amended with with descriptive variable names
[5] For each Activity and Subject a mean values has been calculated. For each original column xxx_std() or xxx_mean() a corresponding variable Mean_xxx_std() and Mean_xxx_mean() have been included in the current dataset.
